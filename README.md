# A VGA controller using FPGA board
For this project, we used FPGA board DE2-115 to implement it as a controller for VGA, and make it possible to control a square moving around the screen under the control of the switches on the board. 
This project could also be used to connect to a PS2 keyboard, which makes the controller more realistic as the mordern computer games.
